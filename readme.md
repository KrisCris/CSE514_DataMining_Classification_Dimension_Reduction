# CSE 514 Assignment 2 Classification & Dimension Reduction

## File Structure
- `data/` Folder that contains the training data
- `report`
  - `report.md` My markdown version of the report
  - `report.pdf` My pdf version of the report
  - `results.md` File that contains the formatted output of main.py
  - `imgs/` Folder that holds all the images generated by main.py
- `main.py` The main py file
- `notebook.ipynb` The jupyter notebook that contains majority of code that I originally wrote that are used in main.py
- `requirements.txt` File that contains all the requirements of running main.py and notebook.ipynb
- `readme.md` This file.

## How to Run

1. install python 3.9.12
2. initialize virtual environment by run `python3 -m venv venv` in the folder.
3. activate the virtual environment by run
   1. Windows Powershell: `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
   2. MacOS/Linux Terminal: `. venv/bin/activate`
4. The following only works if you successfully activated the virtual environment, otherwise you need to refer to python's official document for alternative ways.
5. install all the dependencies in requirements.txt by run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Run main.py by run `python main.py`

If you want to try `notebook.ipynb`, I would recommend run it in Visual Studio Code, which comes with jupyter support. However you may still need to configure some settings.
